Solid waste, especially municipal solid waste is a huge problem in the world. This problem has become more dangerous due to increase of the population. In this proposal we are mainly discussing how to reduce the generation of solid waste and how to achieve economical and environmental benefits. First, we want to identify the current situation of municipal solid waste management in Sri Lanka and I broad down it to a particular area to analyze. In that area we looked at the current procedure. Then get the waste generation data and divided into several types of waste as well as compare the waste generation with the population on different years. After that we looked into problems that people are currently facing because of the improper MSW management process. After identified the problems, I came up with different kind of solutions that affordable, effective, easy implementable and maintainable.
